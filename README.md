# API Authentication with Node

The code in this repository is based on the
[API Authentication with Node](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zx6jnaLuB9Q)
video.

The first set of videos did local Authentication and the OAuth2 part of the
tutorial started with
[this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0IxtqZ08Jo)
video.

The unit testing video tutorial is
[here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O1TYpzm5Uh0)
and the
[github repo](https://github.com/eXtremeXR/APIAuthenticationWithNode/)
contains code that is different and better than that shown in the video.
